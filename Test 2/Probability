An urn contains 8 balls : 4 red , 2 blue and 2 green. Now n balls are drawn out of the urn. Calculate the probability that out of n drawn balls exactly x balls are red.
Find your answer multiplied by 100 and return the integer part.
All required values for computation will be in integer range.
x is always less than equal to 4 and x is always less than equal to n.
Input format :
Two spaced integers : n and x
Output format :
Integer part of (Probability * 100). 
Sample Input 1 :
3 1
Sample Output 1:
42

    public static int factorial(int n) {
			int fact = 1;
			for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
				fact = fact * i;
			}
			return fact;
		}

		public static int NCR(int n, int r) {
			int factn = factorial(n);
			int factr = factorial(r);
			int factnr = factorial(n - r);
			return factn / (factr * factnr);

                int favourableOutcome = NCR(4, x) * NCR(4, n - x);
			int totalOutcome = NCR(8, n);
			int ans = (favourableOutcome*100) / totalOutcome;
			return ans;
